# On_The_Map
Udacity iOS Nanodegree On the Map Project

This project is for the Networking course for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree

In this project, I learned how to make various networking requests to pull/post/delete/put data from the Udacity and Parse servers. Udacity privately hosts the parse server now, since it was recently shutdown.

Users will need a Udacity account to login, and will be able to see the positions of the most recent 100 students. Users will also be able to post their own location with a URL to a website.
